Seven Tears are flowing to the river
And six of 'em are mine:
And I taste the foreign liquid
That mixes up with mine
To read in it of the strength
That I gave away to so many
And joy it was in my mouth
And I fell into a deep ocean
And the old wound hurts again
Droolingly it laughs within all the sorrow
But when the flood recovered his corpse
After he had lost six tears
The water became his coffin
A seventh tear fell ... out of agony
And when the river lead the tear
To the eternal ocean
He finally was loved
But for sure he doesn't know that anymore
And if time could be turned back
And all the pain was just a dream
He'll put his arms around her
And love would be in both of their hearts
